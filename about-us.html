<h3>Brunnhilda</h3>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54848877/64393422-4adbe780-d01f-11e9-9635-ba1c6c726256.jpg" alt="Brunnhilde" width="160"
height="160" align="left"/>Although Allen Alcorn is credited with creating Pong while working for Atari, the truth is that it was created by <br />Brunnhilde the Viking Cat in an effort to meet the digital needs of cats. 
The original Brunnhilde appeared in 1936 <br />in a photograph by Adolph E. Weidhaas. She has returned throughout history to meet the needs of the feline population. <br />No one knows when Brunnhilde will return but she <em>will</em> return.

<h3>Salem</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/jcpask/gamer-truth.html/salem.jpg"/>
    Salem is most widely known as the familiar of Sabrina, the witch.  His knowledge of magick is wide ranging and he is an effective operator in the occult world.  Prior to his time as a familiar, however, Salem worked as a design consultant for many early video game companies.  Having freshly left graduate school, he worked on the team designing both <em>Breakout</em> and <em>Arkanoid</em> to arcades and other platforms.  He remembers wishing to add "a sense that there's more than just the player and some controller knobs--that there is more at stake."  Salem now lives in Greendale with his family.
