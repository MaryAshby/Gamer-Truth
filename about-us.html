  <p>Although Allen Alcorn is credited with creating Pong while working for Atari, the truth is that it was created by Brunnhilde the Viking Cat in an effort to meet the digital needs of cats. 
The original Brunnhilde appeared in 1936 in a photograph by Adolph E. Weidhaas. She has returned throughout history to meet the needs of the feline population. No one knows when Brunnhilde will return but she will return.
