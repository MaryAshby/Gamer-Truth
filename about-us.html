  <p>Although Allen Alcorn is credited with creating Pong while working for Atari, the truth is that it was created by <br />Brunnhilde the Viking Cat in an effort to meet the digital needs of cats. 
The original Brunnhilde appeared in 1936 <br />in a photograph by Adolph E. Weidhaas. She has returned throughout history to meet the needs of the feline population. <br />No one knows when Brunnhilde will return but she <em>will</em> return.
